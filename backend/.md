Prompt for AI Business Rule & Prediction Engine

Title:
Automatically detect domains, generate business rules, and explain insights from uploaded datasets

Instructions for AI:

Upload Data

Accept multiple CSV, XLS, XLSX files.

Merge or analyze files individually.

Detect columns, data types, and remove irrelevant ID/unique columns.

Detect Business Domain

Use column names and data types to determine domain (HR, Finance, Sales, Operations, or General).

Provide confidence score and matched columns.

If confidence is low, add a note: “Domain detection may be unreliable due to few records or generic column names.”

Analyze Relationships

Identify key features that influence target variables.

Calculate feature importance and impact levels (High, Medium, Low).

Show summary table of top 5 features with average values.

Generate Predictions

Use rule-based regression or classification depending on target column type.

Show sample predictions alongside actual values.

Include performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) and explain limitations.

Create Business Rules

Use Apriori Algorithm for association rules.

Use If-Then rules for numeric/categorical targets.

For each rule, include:

Rule expression (IF … THEN …)

Confidence & Lift

Impact on target (High/Medium/Low)

Purpose in plain English – explain why this rule matters and how it can be applied.

Summarize Insights

Explain key patterns discovered in simple, human-understandable English.

Highlight which features have highest impact on predictions.

Give actionable recommendations: what the user can do next.

Mention limitations: small dataset, low R², prediction uncertainty.

Optional Visualizations

Feature importance bar chart

Prediction vs actual comparison

Association rules network graph

Heatmap for key metrics (like employee satisfaction or sales)
